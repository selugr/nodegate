# Aggregate

> Aggregate a request response into the container's body.

## aggregate(method, url, [options])

Execute a request with, by default, the `container`'s `headers` and `body` the contents of the
container and aggregate the response to the `container`'s body. Existing keys of the `container`'s
body will be overwrited by the reponse ones.

### Arguments

| Argument | Type       | Description                                 |
| :------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| method   | **string** | **Required.** Method of the request.        |
| url      | **string** | **Required.** URL to call.                  |
| options  | **object** | Options for the request.                    |

The third argument `options` is an object accepting these keys:

 - `failStatusCodes`: Array of generic status codes which will break the workflow, starting the
 worklows `onError` option. The default value is `[400, 500]`.
 - `path`: [object path](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path){:target="_blank"} like
 destination for the response of the request. Like the `container`'s body, existing keys will be
 overwritted.
 - `body`: object describing the body to send with the request, the values of each key must be an
 [object path](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path){:target="_blank"} from the `container`.
 - `headers`: same usage as the body, but for the headers.
 - `errorOptions`: It's an object that will provide custom information to our response in case of failure.

## Examples

Let's assume a fictionnal API `https://myapi.com/:username` responding with some data for a user:

```json
{
  "username": "shudrum",
  "birthdate": "1982-12-28"
}
```

You can create a simple bridge like this, the response of the gateway will be exactly the same as
the API:

```js
gateway.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/:username',
  workflow: [
    aggregate('get', 'https://myapi.com/{params.username}'),
  ],
});
```

Using two workers and the `path` option you can request two user on the sametime:

```js
gateway.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/:user1/:user2',
  workflow: [
    aggregate('get', 'https://myapi.com/{params.user1}', {
      target: 'user1',
    }),
    aggregate('get', 'https://myapi.com/{params.user2}', {
      target: 'user2',
    }),
  ],
});
```

The reponse of a request matching this route will be like this one:

```json
{
  "user1": {
    "username": "shudrum",
    "birthdate": "1982-12-28"
  },
  "user2": {
    "username": "anotherprofile",
    "birthdate": "1992-06-30"
  },
}
```

### Custom errors

You can set a custom message for different errors based on their status code when they're triggered by a request,

```js
gateway.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/:username',
  workflow: [
    aggregate('get', `https://myapi.com/priceChecking?amount=xxx`, {
      id: 'priceChecking',
      errorOptions: {
        includeMetaInfo: true,
        messages: {
          400: 'Custom and detailed message for this aggregate request',
          418: 'This is not a regular teapot error message anymore ðŸ«–',
        }
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

By setting up includeMetaInfo to "true" a meta field will be added to body with information about the aggregate function that threw the error:

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "url": "https://myapi.com/priceChecking?amount=xxx",
        "id": "priceChecking"
    },
    "error": "Custom and detailed message for this aggregate request"
}
```
